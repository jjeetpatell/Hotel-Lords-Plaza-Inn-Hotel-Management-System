# Hotel-Lords-Plaza-Inn-Hotel-Management-System
In my High-School, I developed a Fully-Functional Hotel Management Program in C++. It comprises of around 500 lines of code. 
In this project, you can Book a Room wherein you are allowed to enter Customer Details, ask for the Customer Record, ask for Rooms Allocated to different Customers, you can Edit the Record of the Customer, whether the Customer has left the Hotel or not in order to allocate or deallocate the room assigned to the Customer, ask for the Complete Food Menu followed by ordering the Food for the Customer and at the end generates a Food Bill of the Customer who bought the Food.
This code might not run in Visual Studio Code. So, I recommend you running this in Turbo C/C++ Compiler.
